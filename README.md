# Cipher-Project
This project implements both Caesar Cipher (encoding/decoding) and Substitution Cipher (encoding/decoding) tools in C++.
The goal is to build correct, efficient, and test-compliant cryptographic functions following the project guide.

Project Overview

This repository contains implementations for:

1. Caesar Cipher

    Encode text using Caesar shift

    Decode text by testing all rotations

    Full command parsing using getline

    Proper character handling with toupper + casting

2. Substitution Cipher

    Encode by applying a 26-letter key

    Decode using a hill-climbing algorithm with English scoring

    Resetting & swapping logic to avoid incorrect convergence

    Supports decrypting entire files encoded with one key

Build & Run Instructions:
Use make — Do NOT run code manually

The project requires using Make commands instead of running via IDE buttons or typing clang++ manually.
Tests and runners depend on the provided Makefile.

Common Issues & Fixes:
Below is a consolidated list of frequently asked questions from the FAQ:

 Caesar Cipher — Known Issues
 “utils.h not found”

Always run the project using make, not the Run button or manual compile.
This resolves include-path issues. 
Strings turn into numbers

Because toupper, tolower, etc. return int, inserting them directly into a stream prints ASCII numbers.

Fix:

ss << (char)toupper(c);

Program hangs / infinite loop

Caused by mixing >> and getline.
Use only getline for all console input.

Decoder gives repeated or unordered outputs

The rot function modifies the vector passed by reference.

Calling rot(vec,1) then rot(vec,2) actually rotates by 3.
Use a fresh copy for each test.

Output looks correct, but tests fail

Common mistakes:

Not using putTogetherWithSpaces

Not printing each decrypted line separately

Extra console output beyond expected values

Substitution Cipher — Known Issues
applySubstitutionCipher fails tests but works manually

Tests expect:

Conversion of lowercase → uppercase

Non-alphabet characters preserved

Correct handling of "Mr. Jock, TV quiz PhD, bags few lynx."

Hill-climbing stops too early

The rule “1000 trials in a row without improvement” is often misread.
It does not mean “1000 total trials.”

Decryption is too fast and inaccurate

Initial “best score” must NOT be zero, because all Englishness scores are negative.

Gets stuck at a local max

You must:

Run hill-climbing 25 separate times

Reset swaps correctly

Compare each trial to the current iteration’s best score, NOT previous runs

Code is extremely slow or hangs

Likely calling:

applySubstitutionCipher

getScore

clean
too often in loops.

Minimize repeated computation.

File Decryption Issues
Output file looks right but tests fail

Most common causes:

Missing newline at end of a line

Extra newline at end of file

Using while(!infile.eof()) — never do this

Use:

while (getline(infile, line)) {
    ...
}

File decode wrong even though console version works

You must decrypt the entire file using a single key, not per line.
Each line decrypted with its own key produces gibberish.

C++ Function Declarations

If you get:

use of undeclared identifier


You must declare helper functions at the top of ciphers.cpp:

void rot(vector<string>&, int);


Real C++ projects use header files, but this assignment requires everything in a single .cpp.

Tips for Passing All Tests

Follow input/output formats exactly

Avoid extra prints

Use helper functions you wrote

Reset state fully between decoder iterations

Verify character handling carefully

Recreate plaintext.txt using your passing decryption
